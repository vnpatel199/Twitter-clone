You need to create a mini Twitter app with the following minimal features:
-> User can post a tweet (140 char limit)
-> User can follow other users. Possibly implement unfollow.
-> User should be able to see a timeline of tweets created by them and the people they follow. Figure out the sorting here :)

Bonus: Implement websockets for realtime updates in feed.

Limitations

Feel free to use any language/frameworks for frontend and backend. But they need to be separate apps.
For websockets, you cannot use hosted services like pubnub or pusher. Implement using native libraries like socket.io or faye.
You can use any framework (antd, semanticUI etc) you want to speed up the Frontend.
